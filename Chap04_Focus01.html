			<H3 STYLE="text-align:center;">BARBED WIRE</H3>
				<IMG STYLE="text-align:bottom; border:2px solid;" HEIGHT="130" SRC="images/barbed1.jpg" WIDTH="150" /> Concertina Barbed Wire in roll form is used in high security areas to deter trespassing men and animals. The effectiveness of this material is proved as it has been in use for more than 75 years during war and peace.
		<OL><P><LI><B><I>Line Wire:</I></B><BR/>This is made up of 3.05mm diameter high carbon steel wire, with a tensile strength of 170 to 180 kg/mm². The wire is drawn and dressed in such a manner that the coils formed will fall naturally into the specified diameter without forming a figure eight. Line wire is heavy hot dipped galvanized with minimum inc coating of 185 gm/mm2.</LI></P>
	<P><LI><B><I>Barbed Wire:</I></B><BR/>This is 2.00mm diameter bright mild steel wire with a tensile strength of 38 to 55kg/mm² conforming to BS 1052. The wire is hot dipped galvanized with a minimum zinc coating of 20 to 50 gm/mm². The barbs are formed with four points. Spacing between the centers of the barbs of every 70mm along the length of the wire. The barbs are firmly secured by indentations made on the wire, so that the barbs do not rotate or slide along the wire. The four points of the barbs are formed at the right angles to one another and project outwards approximately 12mm from the center of the wire.</LI></P>
	<P><LI><B><I>Carrying Handles:</I></B><BR/>Handles are made of mild steel wire of 3.55mm diameter and are attached to the outer turn of the coil on each side.</LI></P></OL>

	<h3 style="text-align:center">BARBED TAPES</H3>
		<IMG STYLE="text-align:bottom;border:3px solid;"  Height="130" Src="images/barbed.jpg" Width="150" />Barbed Tapes are used as psychological and physical deterrent against intrusion by personnel and animals. Barbed tape barrier systems are more vicious and difficult to tamper with, providing superior perimeter security. Some of the users are military installations, nuclear energy sites, maximum-security prisons, various petroleum installations, tank farms and other important industrial facilities.
	<UL><P><LI><DT><B><I>Short Blade Barbed Tape (SBBT):</I></B><BR/>
		<DD>To give the maximum tensile strength at the time of the breach hard drawn steel cord is used (ES1). For camouflage purposes, a coaltar coating can be applied over the entire surface (ES-1), and to attain the high degree of rust resistance, the core wire is made of galvanized steel (ES-2). Any of the above three options are available to meet your specific requirements.</DD></DT></LI></P>
		<P><LI><DT><B><I>Medium Blade Barbed Tape (MBBT):</I></B><BR/>
		<DD>The specification of the "ivory" tape is similar to those of ES types. The blades are sharper and have a greater pricking capacity. The life of this tape is more than three times longer than those of ES types. Therefore, "ivory" tape is a more effective choice in terrain which has heavy rain or in coastal areas. The diameter will be similar to ES type.</DD></DT></LI></P>
	<P><LI><DT><B><I>Long Blade Barbed Tape (LBBT):</I></B><BR/>
		<DD>This is the most effective psychological and physical deterrent, ever made as a barrier obstacle. It is available in authentic stainless steel (SUS 430) and the core wire can be fabricated from either galvanized carbon steel or stainless steel.</DD></DT></LI></P>

	<H3 STYLE="text-align:center;">ANIMAL FENCING</H3>
		<IMG STYLE="text-align:bottom;border:3px solid;" HEIGHT="130" SRC="images/fence1.jpg" WIDTH="150" />DEPL's animal fencing system is mainly used as an anti-intrusion barrier against any farm and other animals.  <P> The most common use is on highways where vast distances are covered at a very economical cost.  <P> Animal fencing can also be used to enclose areas such as farms, forest areas and national parks, where security is not crucial.  <P> This system is easy to install and can be erected in a comparatively short time.<HR/>
